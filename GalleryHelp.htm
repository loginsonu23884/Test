    <p> 
        Welcome to Phoenix Art Group’s newest art gallery featuring a complete catalog of 
        our artwork.  In order to maintain the integrity of our imagery, we ask your 
        partnership in sharing imagery on this website with your customers only.  
    </p> 
    <p> 
        This website allows you to browse thousands of images and to create “galleries” 
        of selected imagery for your reference and/or to email to your customers. The 
        website provides many opportunities in one convenient gallery page. 
        The following is a list of topics to guide you through the options available to 
        you.

    <p> 
    <b><a name="s1">Search Images</a></b> 
    <br /> 
    The gallery allows you to filter artwork by medium, style, or artist, in any 
    combination.  Once your filters are in place, click the “search” button for results.   
    Note:  Setting criteria will not have an affect on any personal galleries that are open.
    </p> 
    <p> 
    <b><a name="s2">Clearing Search Criteria</a></b> 
    <br /> 
    Clicking the “Clear” button will clear gallery search criteria.  All filters will 
    return to their default positions.   Note:  Setting criteria will not have an 
    affect on any personal galleries that are open.
    </p> 
    <p> 
    <b><a name="g1">How to Create a Gallery</a></b> 
    <br /> 
    You can create individual galleries containing images selected for your purposes.  
    Once a gallery is created, you can print the images in a thumbnail format 
    (multiple images per page) or with one large image per page.  You can also send 
    email links to customers that allow them to view only images contained in the created 
    gallery (see Gallery Help topics for details).  Galleries are created by selecting 
    the “Galleries” button (bottom right of page) and choosing New Gallery.  
    You will then be prompted with a Save dialog box: <br /><br /> 
        <img src="../Images/Gallery/Original/SaveGalleryDialog.JPG" /><br /><br /> 
    You may give the gallery any name you choose.  Once named, click the “Save” button; 
    you will see the new gallery name in the open gallery at the bottom of the webpage.  
    You may now begin adding images to this newly created gallery.  The save gallery 
    dialog will also be displayed if no current gallery is open and you choose to 
    “Add Selections to Gallery” or “Add All to My Gallery”.  
    </p>  
    
    <a name="g2" class="TopicHeading">How to Add Selected Images to a Gallery</a> 
    <br /><br /> 
    <b>Add Selections to My Gallery</b><br /> 
    You must first create a new gallery or open an existing gallery before images can 
    be added.  You may add images to a gallery by clicking your selections and pressing 
    the “Add Selection to Gallery” button on the bottom left of the page.  Your selections 
    will be displayed as thumbnail images as the bottom of the page. 
    <br /><br />    
    <b>Add All to My Gallery</b><br /> 
    This option puts every image on the website into your gallery all at one time without 
    having to make individual selections on each page.  This option is typically used when 
    you utilize filters to achieve specific search results and want to add all of those 
    results images to a gallery.  CAUTION:  Once you add images to a gallery using this 
    option, removing any of these images has to be done one at a time.  You should be sure 
    that the gallery you have open is the one in which you want to put all these images.
    <br /><br /> 
    <img src="AddAllToMyGallery.JPG" /> 
    <p> 
    <b><a name="g3">How to Open an Existing Gallery</a></b> 
    <br /> 
    At the time a gallery is created or an existing gallery is opened, it automatically 
    becomes the “open/working gallery” and images may be added as selected.  To open an 
    existing gallery, simply choose from the drop down gallery list.  You can switch 
    between galleries as often as needed.  Again, the most recent gallery selected will 
    be the gallery into which imagery is added. <br /><br /> 
        <img src="../Images/Gallery/Original/OpenGalleryDialog.JPG" /> 
    </p> 
    <p> 
    <b><a name="g4">How to print my galleries</a></b> 
    <br /> 
    The selected gallery must be opened to enable printing. Once open, click the 
    “Email/Print Options” button and choose either the Thumbnail Report (multiple images 
    on a page) or the Detail Report (single, larger image per page).  When selected, 
    a new page is created that formats your gallery selections for viewing and printing.  
    You can print this page by selecting File=>Print from your browser’s menu bar. 
    <br /><br /> 
    If you experience problems with images showing up on your browser, check to see if 
    you have a pop-up blocker enabled, which will prevent the images from being visible.
    <br /><br /> 
        <img src="../Images/Gallery/Original/PrintGalleryImages.JPG" /> 
    </p> 
    <p> 
    <b><a name="g5">How to email my galleries</a></b> 
    <br /> 
    The selected gallery must be open to enable emailing.  Once opened, click the 
    “Email/Print Options” button and choose from the following:  
    <br /><br /> 
    <b>Email Link</b><br /> 
    We strongly encourage you to send imagery via the “Email Link,” because the email 
    contains only the text of the link and will therefore not exceed the maximum size 
    limitations on the receiver’s computer.  There is no limit to the number of images 
    that can be sent in an email link.  It’s clean, easy and fast – and the recipient will 
    see only the images you sent; they cannot get back onto our website via this link.
    <br /><br /> 
    <b>Email with Attachments</b><br /> 
    One of the biggest obstacles to sending emails with attachments is the large size of 
    the file being sent.  Many email services have maximum size limits for incoming emails 
    and will reject anything larger than its capacity.  This option is suitable for sending 
    a few images.
    <br /><br /> 
        <img src="../Images/Gallery/Original/EmailGalleryImages.JPG" /> 
     
    <br /><br />   
    Once you’ve made a choice, an email form will pop up for you to complete.  Fill in the “To”, 
    “Subject”, and type any text you would like to include in the body of the email.   
    When complete, click the send button on the lower right side of the email dialog box.
    <br /><br /> 
        <img src="../Images/Gallery/Original/SendGalleryEmail.JPG" /> 
    </p> 
    <p> 
    <b><a name="g6">How to modify an Existing Gallery</a></b> 
    <br /> 
    To modify an existing gallery, you must first open it by selecting it from the gallery drop down list.  
    <br /><br /> 
        <img src="../Images/Gallery/Original/SelectGallery2.JPG" /> 
    <br /><br /> 
    Once the gallery is open, you can view images in a large format, add additional images, or delete images.
    <br /><br /> 
        <img src="../Images/Gallery/Original/ModifyExistingGalleries.JPG" /> 
    <p> 
    <b><a name="a1">How to change User Password and Account Information</a></b> 
    <br /> 
    You can change your user password or update your account information by selecting User 
    Management from the menu bar. <br /><br /> 
        <img src="../Images/Gallery/Original/ChangeUserPassword.JPG" />
